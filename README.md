Bing Desktop Mac
================

A status bar application for Mac OS X which looks for the latest background on the Bing homepage, downloads it and sets it as the wallpaper for your Mac. Supports Mac OS X 10.8+ (tested on OS X 10.11). Currently development is still ongoing, but will upload the app when confident in it. 

Not in any way intended to infringe Microsoft's or Bing's property.
